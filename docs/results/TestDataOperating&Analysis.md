## Test Data Cleaning

The test data contained inconsistencies in the number of rows across different columns, as well as variations in some column names. To ensure proper data handling, these discrepancies were addressed when loading the `CSV` file. After importing the data, the column names and index were standardized to maintain consistency with the structure of the designed column data. This ensured uniformity in formatting and facilitated seamless data processing.
