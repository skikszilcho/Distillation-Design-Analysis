title: "Distillation Column Design & Analysis"
description: "An example for the design of a ethanol-water distillation column using a McCabe-Thiele Diagram and other standard chemical engineering formulae. Using a similarly sized distillation column data sourced from Kaggle, a model will be trained for predicting final ethanol distillate concentration and then tested on the designed column."
