# Distillation Column Design & Analysis

---

## [Background & Design Model](#Background-Information)
Distillation is a separation technique based on volatility differences. Data sourced, from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jorgecote/distillation-column], was generated from a mathematical model. Industrial considerations atypical data features like noise, outliers, and missing data have been added, in order to obtain industrial conditions in the dataset. The data contains There are 450 hours of operation at 0.1 hours of time sampling. Using this data, a distillation column was designed and in order for this to be accomplished certain assumptions had to be made. These assumptions included the distillate ethanol concentration, capping of the number of stages, feed temperature, and feed split of ethanol and water. Rudimentary equations were used to determine the vapour pressures of the components, the relative volatility, boil-up ratio, and equilibrium constants for separation.

Using information in [https://doi.org/10.18359/rcin.5644P], following the design of the distillation column, the data is standardised and used to predict the ethanol concentration using the sourced data for model building.

[Problem:](#Problem-Statement) Design of a Binary Distillation Column for Ethanol-Water Separation. The results, including the number of theoretical stages (excl reboiler & condenser stages) & feed stage location will be summarised. Then the distillate ethanol concentration will be predicted and compared to the actual concentration.
