A distillation column is to separate an ethanol-water binary mixture. The system operates under the following conditions:
# [Process Details](#Process-Details)
---
## *1. Feed Characteristics:*
  Feed rate: 600 kmol/hr
  
  Feed composition: 40 mol% ethanol
  
  Feed condition: Saturated liquid

## *2. Product Streams:*
  Distillate flow rate: 260 kmol/hr
  
  Distillate composition: 95 mol% ethanol
  
  Bottoms flow rate: 340 kmol/hr
  
  Bottoms composition: 5 mol% ethanol
  
## *3. Column Operating Conditions:*
  Pressure: 1.01 bar
  
  Total liquid flow rate: 780 kmol/hr
  
  Total vapor flow rate: 1040 kmol/hr

## *4. Additional Information/Assumptions:*
  Column feed temperature: 350 K
  
  Ethanol concentration in distillate: 0.805
  
  Assume no heat losses, and the column operates at steady-state conditions.
  
  Raoult's Law applies
  
  Use the McCabe-Thiele method for analysis.
