A distillation column is to separate an ethanol-water binary mixture. The system operates under the following conditions:
## [*Process Details*:]

[1. Feed Characteristics:]
  Feed rate: 600 kmol/hr
  Feed composition: 40 mol% ethanol
  Feed condition: Saturated liquid

[2. Product Streams:]
  Distillate flow rate: 260 kmol/hr
  Distillate composition: 95 mol% ethanol
  Bottoms flow rate: 340 kmol/hr
  Bottoms composition: 5 mol% ethanol

[3. Column Operating Conditions:]
  Pressure: 1.01 bar
  Total liquid flow rate: 780 kmol/hr
  Total vapor flow rate: 1040 kmol/hr

[4. Additional Information/Assumptions:]
  Column feed temperature: 350 K
  Ethanol concentration in distillate: 0.805
  Assume no heat losses, and the column operates at steady-state conditions.
  Raoult's Law applies
  Use the McCabe-Thiele method for analysis.
